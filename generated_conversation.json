  "transcribed_text": "Doctor: Good morning, Mr. Edwards.  It's Dr. Carter. How are you feeling today?\n\nPatient:  Morning, Doctor.  A little winded, to be honest.  Still having some shortness of breath, especially when I climb the stairs.\n\nDoctor: I see from your chart that you reported shortness of breath back in March of 2025.  Has it been consistent since then, or are there any triggers you’ve noticed?\n\nPatient: It's been pretty much ongoing, but it's worse after I've done anything that makes my heart rate go up, like gardening or even just a brisk walk.\n\nDoctor: Okay. And how about your hyperlipidemia? How are you managing your diet and your Metformin?\n\nPatient:  The diet's been... a challenge.  I try, but it's hard to give up my favorite things. I’m taking the Metformin regularly, though.\n\nDoctor:  We discussed diet changes back in August of 2022.  I'm glad you’re taking the Metformin. Your recent cholesterol levels are actually quite good at 63 mg/dL, that's a significant improvement.  However, your creatinine level at 178 mg/dL is concerningly high.  That suggests we need to investigate kidney function further.\n\nPatient:  Kidney function?  I didn’t know that was a problem.\n\nDoctor:  It's something we need to explore.  The high creatinine could be related to several things, including the Metformin itself, or it could indicate another underlying issue. We'll need to run some further blood tests, including a more comprehensive metabolic panel, and possibly a urine test to assess kidney function.\n\nPatient: Okay, Doctor.  Whatever you think is best.\n\nDoctor:  We also need to address your shortness of breath.  Given your age and the persistent nature of the symptom, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and possibly an EKG to rule out any cardiac issues.  In the meantime, try to avoid strenuous activity and rest when you feel short of breath. Do you experience any chest pain or discomfort?\n\nPatient:  No chest pain, thankfully.\n\nDoctor: Excellent. Let's schedule those tests for next week.  I'll also contact a cardiologist for a consultation following the results.  We’ll then reassess your treatment plan for both the hyperlipidemia and the shortness of breath, taking into account your kidney function results.  Do you have any questions for me?\n\nPatient: No, I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor.\n\nDoctor: You're welcome, Mr. Edwards.  We'll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next appointment."
